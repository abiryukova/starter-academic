My name is Avgustina Biryukova. I am a Linguistics PhD student at University of Paris VIII. I am interested in the semantics of emotions from the cogntive-linguistic perspective. Previously I studied Translation and Interpretation at Kemerovo State University (Russia) for five years and then continued my Master studies at University of Paris VIII.

In my PhD, I am looking at *boredom* in three languages/ cultures: English, French and Russian. I use blog corpora to determine how speakers talk about boredom and how they avoit it in everyday life using statistical modelling in R.
